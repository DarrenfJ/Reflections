When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would do this in any situation where I was workign with other people on a project,
or where we were not all located in the lame geographical location.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I would only want to opull or ush changes when I felt I was ready.. i.e. with a owrking prototype 
or something worth sharing.
