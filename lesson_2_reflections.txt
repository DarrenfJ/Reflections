What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates the .git repository and allows you to begine tracking changes and doing commits


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value 
do you think it offers?

The stagin area seems to offer up a place for files to 'sit' before they are committed. 
Like preparing for jumping out of an airplane... you have to line up near the door


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Make sure you commit any time there's a major 'logical' change to what you are working on


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? 
How would branches help?

Specifically when working on something that is slightly different than the original and might 
go off and become it's own 'thing'


How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

they 'show' the branches in a tree-like way and also make it clean what is not reachable if 
not labelled into its own branch. this will set us up nicely to understand merging, methinks.
