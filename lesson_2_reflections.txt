What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates the .git repository and allows you to begine tracking changes and doing commits


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value 
do you think it offers?

The stagin area seems to offer up a place for files to 'sit' before they are committed. 
Like preparing for jumping out of an airplane... you have to line up near the door
